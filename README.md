## Key Features

üß† **AI-Powered Assessment**
- OpenAI-driven confidence scoring (0-100) for ZoomInfo enrichment quality
- Intelligent corrections and inferences with advanced redundancy validation
- Context-aware analysis using sales segment and channel data

- Cross-validation between ZoomInfo data and internal estimates
- Robust Lead ID handling (15 ‚Üî 18 character conversion)
- Enhanced data type validation (rejects vague employee counts like "Small", "Large")

üìä **Three Analysis Methods**
- **Single Lead Assessment**: Individual confidence scoring with detailed explanations
- **SOQL Query Analysis**: Bulk processing with complex query support (JOINs, UNIONs)
- **Excel File Upload**: Batch analysis from uploaded Lead ID lists

üìà **Professional Excel Export**
- RingCentral-branded reports with color-coded confidence scores
- Summary statistics and individual lead breakdowns with AI explanations
- Consistent export data (cached analysis results prevent AI variability)
- Multiple export formats for different analysis types

‚ö° **Enhanced User Experience**
