- `Company` vs `ZI_Company_Name__c` - Lead-provided vs ZoomInfo company name
- `ZI_Employees__c` - ZoomInfo employee count for segment validation

### Computed Analysis
- `email_domain` - Extracted email domain for validation
- `not_in_TAM` - Quality flag for missing enrichment on large companies
- `suspicious_enrichment` - Quality flag for potentially incorrect data

### AI Assessment Output
- `confidence_score` - Overall reliability rating (0-100)
- `explanation_bullets` - Clear explanations with emoji indicators
- `corrections` - High-confidence fixes (â‰¥80% confidence) with website validation
- `inferences` - Lower-confidence suggestions (â‰¥40% confidence) with accessibility checks

## Analysis Methods

### 1. Single Lead Assessment
Direct confidence scoring for individual leads with detailed AI explanations.

### 2. SOQL Query Analysis  
Bulk processing supporting complex queries:
- Simple filters: `WHERE Email LIKE '%@gmail.com'`
- JOINs: `SELECT Lead.Id FROM Lead JOIN Account ON...`
- UNIONs: `SELECT Id FROM Lead WHERE... UNION ALL...`
- Subqueries: `WHERE AccountId IN (SELECT...)`

### 3. Excel File Upload
Step-by-step workflow with partial validation support:
1. **Parse** - Extract sheet names and column headers
2. **Select** - Choose sheet and Lead ID column
3. **Validate** - Verify Lead IDs with detailed valid/invalid breakdown
4. **Analyze** - Run AI assessment on valid leads (invalid Lead IDs preserved)
5. **Export** - Generate combined Excel report with invalid Lead IDs highlighted in red

## Excel Export Features

## Enhanced Batch Processing for Large Datasets

### Overview

The system now includes optimized batch processing specifically designed to handle Excel files with 50,000+ Lead IDs efficiently while preventing Salesforce connection timeouts and API rate limiting issues.

### Key Features

#### 1. **Multi-Level Batching Strategy**
- **Salesforce Queries**: Processes leads in configurable batches (default: 150 leads per batch)
- **AI Processing**: Sub-batches AI assessments (default: 50 leads per sub-batch) to manage OpenAI rate limits
- **Connection Management**: Automatically refreshes Salesforce connections between batches
- **Error Recovery**: Continues processing even if individual batches fail

#### 2. **Automatic Dataset Detection**
- **Small Datasets** (â‰¤1000 leads): Uses standard processing for optimal speed
- **Large Datasets** (>1000 leads): Automatically switches to batch-optimized processing
- **Configurable Threshold**: Customize via `LARGE_DATASET_THRESHOLD` environment variable

#### 3. **Performance Optimizations**
```
Processing Pipeline for 50k Leads:
Excel Upload â†’ Validation (150/batch) â†’ Salesforce Data (150/batch) â†’ AI Processing (50/batch) â†’ Export
```

#### 4. **Progress Tracking & Monitoring**
- Real-time batch completion tracking
- Performance metrics (leads/second, avg batch time)
- Success/failure rates per batch
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

### API Endpoints

#### Standard Excel Analysis
```
POST /excel/analyze
```
- Automatically detects dataset size
- Uses batch optimization for >1000 leads
- Maintains backward compatibility

#### Batch-Optimized Analysis
```
POST /excel/analyze-batch-optimized
```
- Explicit batch processing with configurable parameters
- Form parameters:
  - `batch_size`: Salesforce batch size (50-200, default: 200)
  - `ai_batch_size`: AI processing batch size (10-100, default: 50)

### Configuration Options

Environment variables for fine-tuning batch processing:

```bash
# Salesforce batch size (recommended: 100-150 for stability)
BATCH_SIZE_SALESFORCE=150

# AI processing batch size (recommended: 25-50 for rate limiting)
BATCH_SIZE_AI=50

# Lead ID validation batch size
BATCH_SIZE_VALIDATION=150

# Threshold for using batch optimization
LARGE_DATASET_THRESHOLD=1000

# Delays between batches (milliseconds)
BATCH_DELAY_MS=50
AI_BATCH_DELAY_MS=100
```

### Performance Metrics

#### Expected Processing Times (50k Leads)
- **Validation**: ~5-8 minutes (150 leads/batch)
- **Salesforce Data Retrieval**: ~10-15 minutes (150 leads/batch) 
- **AI Processing**: ~45-60 minutes (50 leads/batch, respecting rate limits)
- **Total**: ~60-80 minutes for complete analysis

#### Resource Management
- **Memory**: Processes in chunks to prevent memory exhaustion
- **API Limits**: Built-in rate limiting and exponential backoff
- **Connection Stability**: Automatic connection refresh between batches
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with partial results

### Batch Processing Benefits

1. **Prevents Timeouts**: No single operation exceeds Salesforce timeout limits
2. **Rate Limit Compliance**: Respects both Salesforce and OpenAI API limits  
3. **Memory Efficient**: Processes data in chunks without loading entire dataset
4. **Fault Tolerant**: Continues processing even if individual batches fail
5. **Progress Visibility**: Real-time tracking of processing status
6. **Scalable**: Handles datasets from 1K to 100K+ leads efficiently

### Best Practices

#### For 50k+ Lead Processing:
- Use `BATCH_SIZE_SALESFORCE=100` for maximum stability
- Set `AI_BATCH_DELAY_MS=200` to be conservative with OpenAI rate limits
- Monitor processing via console logs for progress tracking
- Consider processing during off-peak hours for optimal API performance

#### Error Recovery:
- Failed batches are logged but don't stop overall processing
- Invalid Lead IDs are tracked separately and included in final export
- Connection failures trigger automatic reconnection attempts

## Usage Examples

### Web Interface (Recommended)
The interactive interface at `/ui` provides:
- **Single Lead**: Enter Lead ID for instant confidence assessment
- **Bulk Analysis**: Write SOQL queries with preview before full analysis
- **Excel Upload**: Drag-and-drop workflow with partial validation and visual error flagging
- **Professional Export**: Download branded Excel reports with invalid Lead ID highlighting
