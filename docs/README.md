### ZoomInfo Enrichment Assessment Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Lead confidence assessment completed successfully",
  "lead_data": {
    "Id": "00Q5e00000ABC123",
    "First_Channel__c": "Website",
    "ZI_Company_Name__c": "ACI Solutions Inc",
    "Email": "lmcguire@acisolutions.net",
    "Website": "acisolutions.net",
    "ZI_Employees__c": 24,
    "LS_Enrichment_Status__c": "true",
    "email_domain": "acisolutions.net",
    "not_in_TAM": false,
    "suspicious_enrichment": false
  },
  "confidence_assessment": {
    "confidence_score": 75,
    "explanation_bullets": [
      "‚úÖ Email domain matches company domain.",
      "‚ö†Ô∏è Low employee count (24) raises credibility concerns.",
      "‚ö†Ô∏è Lack of website enrichment lowers completeness.",
      "‚ö†Ô∏è Small company size may indicate limited data availability."
    ],
    "corrections": {},
    "inferences": {}
  },
  "processing_info": {
    "salesforce_message": "Lead retrieved successfully with analysis",
    "ai_message": "Assessment generated successfully"
  }
}
```

### Basic Lead Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Lead retrieved successfully with analysis",
  "lead": {
    "Id": "00Q5e00000ABC123",
    "First_Channel__c": "Website",
    "ZI_Company_Name__c": "Example Corp",
    "Email": "john.doe@gmail.com",
    "Website": null,
    "ZI_Employees__c": 250,
    "LS_Enrichment_Status__c": "SUCCESS",
    "email_domain": "gmail.com",
    "not_in_TAM": false,
    "suspicious_enrichment": true
  }
}
```

In this example:
- `email_domain: "gmail.com"` - **NEW**: Extracted email domain for analysis
- `not_in_TAM: false` - Company name is populated, so it's in TAM base
- `suspicious_enrichment: true` - Gmail email + no website + company name + >100 employees suggests potential enrichment issue

## Lead Fields Returned

The API returns the following ZoomInfo-related fields:

### **Core Lead Data**
- `Id` - Salesforce Lead ID
- `First_Channel__c` - First channel information
- `ZI_Company_Name__c` - ZoomInfo company name
- `Email` - Lead email address
- `Website` - Company website
- `ZI_Employees__c` - ZoomInfo employee count
- `LS_Enrichment_Status__c` - Lead enrichment status

### **Enhanced ZoomInfo Analysis Fields**
- `email_domain` - Extracted email domain for validation
- `not_in_TAM` - Boolean indicating if lead should be in RC TAM base
  - `true` when `ZI_Employees__c > 100` but `ZI_Company_Name__c` is null
  - Suggests incomplete ZoomInfo enrichment for companies that should be in Total Addressable Market
- `suspicious_enrichment` - Boolean indicating potentially incorrect ZoomInfo enrichment
  - `true` when email has free domain (gmail, yahoo, etc.) + no website + company name populated + >100 employees
  - Suggests ZoomInfo enrichment may have incorrectly associated personal email with large company

### **AI-Powered ZoomInfo Assessment Fields**
- `confidence_score` - Overall ZoomInfo enrichment confidence rating (0-100)
- `explanation_bullets` - 3-5 clear explanations with emoji indicators for enrichment reliability
- `corrections` - High-confidence fixes suggested by AI for ZoomInfo data
- `inferences` - Lower-confidence guesses for missing ZoomInfo enrichment data

### **Excel Export Features**
- **Professional Formatting**: Color-coded confidence scores, bordered tables, proper column sizing
- **Summary Statistics**: Analysis overview including total leads, issue percentages, average confidence
- **Visual Indicators**: Red highlighting for quality issues, traffic light colors for confidence scores
- **Comprehensive Data**: All lead fields, confidence assessments, explanations, corrections, and inferences
- **Timestamped Files**: Automatic naming with date/time for easy organization

## SOQL Query Support

The API supports flexible SOQL queries for bulk analysis with the following capabilities:

### ‚úÖ **Supported Query Types**

#### **Simple Queries**
```sql
-- Basic filtering
WHERE Email LIKE '%@gmail.com'
WHERE ZI_Employees__c > 100
LIMIT 50

-- Full SELECT statements
SELECT Id FROM Lead WHERE Company = 'Acme Corp'
SELECT Lead.Id FROM Lead WHERE Email IS NOT NULL
```

#### **Complex Queries with JOINs**
```sql
-- Join with Account for filtering
SELECT Lead.Id FROM Lead 
JOIN Account ON Lead.AccountId = Account.Id 
WHERE Account.Industry = 'Technology'

-- Multiple JOINs
SELECT l.Id FROM Lead l 
JOIN Contact c ON l.Email = c.Email 
JOIN Account a ON c.AccountId = a.Id 
WHERE a.AnnualRevenue > 1000000
```

#### **UNION Queries**
```sql
-- Combine different Lead segments
SELECT Id FROM Lead WHERE ZI_Employees__c > 100
UNION ALL
SELECT Id FROM Lead WHERE Email LIKE '%@enterprise.com'

-- Complex UNION with JOINs
SELECT Lead.Id FROM Lead JOIN Account ON Lead.AccountId = Account.Id WHERE Account.Type = 'Customer'
UNION
SELECT Lead.Id FROM Lead WHERE ZI_Company_Name__c LIKE '%Fortune%'
```

#### **Subqueries**
```sql
-- Filter by related Account data
SELECT Id FROM Lead 
WHERE AccountId IN (
    SELECT Id FROM Account 
    WHERE AnnualRevenue > 1000000
)

-- Complex nested filtering
SELECT Id FROM Lead 
WHERE Id NOT IN (
    SELECT LeadId FROM Task 
    WHERE Subject LIKE '%ZoomInfo%'
)
```

### ‚ùå **Security Restrictions**

The following are **blocked for security**:
- **Non-Lead Objects**: `SELECT Id FROM Contact` ‚ùå
- **Non-ID Fields**: `SELECT Name FROM Lead` ‚ùå
- **Dangerous Operations**: `DELETE`, `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, `DROP` ‚ùå
- **Mixed Object UNIONs**: `SELECT Id FROM Lead UNION SELECT Id FROM Contact` ‚ùå

### **Validation Rules**

1. **Result-Focused**: Query must return Lead IDs only
2. **Lead-Centric**: Must involve Lead object in the query
3. **Security-First**: All dangerous SQL operations blocked
4. **Flexible Structure**: JOINs, UNIONs, subqueries allowed if they return Lead IDs

## Development

### Project Architecture
- **Flask Application Factory Pattern**: Clean app initialization
- **Blueprints**: Organized route management
- **Service Layer**: Separation of business logic
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based config
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI-powered confidence scoring

### Adding New Features
1. **Services**: Add business logic to `services/`
2. **Routes**: Add API endpoints to `routes/`
3. **Configuration**: Add config options to `config/config.py`

### Error Handling
All endpoints return standardized JSON responses:
```json
{
  "status": "success|error",
  "message": "Human readable message",
  "data": {}  // Only on success
}
```
