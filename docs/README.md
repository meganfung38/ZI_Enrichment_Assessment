- `POST /excel/export-analysis-with-file` - **Export Excel analysis with original data**

### Web Interface
- `GET /ui` - **Interactive web interface with step-by-step workflows**

## Lead Data Fields

The system analyzes 11+ core fields for comprehensive cross-validation:

### Core Lead Data
- `Id` - Salesforce Lead ID (15 or 18 character format)
- `Email` - Lead email address with domain extraction
- `First_Channel__c` - Lead source channel
- `SegmentName` - Sales segment (SMB, Mid-Market, Enterprise)
- `LS_Company_Size_Range__c` - Internal company size estimate

### Cross-Validation Sources
- `Website` vs `ZI_Website__c` - Lead-provided vs ZoomInfo website
- `Company` vs `ZI_Company_Name__c` - Lead-provided vs ZoomInfo company name
- `ZI_Employees__c` - ZoomInfo employee count for segment validation

### Computed Analysis
- `email_domain` - Extracted email domain for validation
- `not_in_TAM` - Quality flag for missing enrichment on large companies
- `suspicious_enrichment` - Quality flag for potentially incorrect data

### AI Assessment Output
- `confidence_score` - Overall reliability rating (0-100)
- `explanation_bullets` - Clear explanations with emoji indicators
- `corrections` - High-confidence fixes (≥80% confidence)
- `inferences` - Lower-confidence suggestions (≥40% confidence)

## Analysis Methods

### 1. Single Lead Assessment
Direct confidence scoring for individual leads with detailed AI explanations.

### 2. SOQL Query Analysis  
Bulk processing supporting complex queries:
- Simple filters: `WHERE Email LIKE '%@gmail.com'`
- JOINs: `SELECT Lead.Id FROM Lead JOIN Account ON...`
- UNIONs: `SELECT Id FROM Lead WHERE... UNION ALL...`
- Subqueries: `WHERE AccountId IN (SELECT...)`

### 3. Excel File Upload
Step-by-step workflow:
1. **Parse** - Extract sheet names and column headers
2. **Select** - Choose sheet and Lead ID column
3. **Validate** - Verify Lead IDs exist in Salesforce
4. **Analyze** - Run AI assessment on all valid leads
5. **Export** - Generate combined Excel report

## Excel Export Features

Professional reports with RingCentral branding include:
- **Color-coded confidence scores** (Red: 0-59, Orange: 60-79, Blue: 80-100)
- **Original data preservation** with AI analysis appended as new columns
- **Summary statistics** (total leads, issue percentages, average confidence)
- **Individual lead breakdowns** with detailed AI explanations
- **Consistent results** (cached analysis prevents AI response variability)

**Export Columns Added:**
- `AI_Confidence_Score` - Numerical confidence rating
- `AI_Explanation` - Bullet-point explanations with emoji indicators
- `AI_Corrections` - High-confidence data fixes (JSON format)
- `AI_Inferences` - Lower-confidence suggestions (JSON format)
- `AI_Not_in_TAM` - Quality flag for missing enrichment
- `AI_Suspicious_Enrichment` - Quality flag for suspicious data
- `AI_Status` - Analysis completion status

## Usage Examples

### Web Interface (Recommended)
The interactive interface at `/ui` provides:
- **Single Lead**: Enter Lead ID for instant confidence assessment

- **Professional Export**: Download branded Excel reports with cached results

### API Examples

**Single Lead Assessment**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/lead/00Q5e00000ABC123/confidence
```

**Bulk Analysis with Export**
```bash
# 1. Run analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/leads/analyze-query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"soql_query": "WHERE Email LIKE '\''%@gmail.com'\''", "max_analyze": 10}'

# 2. Export results (using cached data)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/leads/export-analysis-data \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"analysis_results": [...], "summary_data": {...}}'
```

## Response Format

All endpoints return standardized JSON:

**Success Response**
```json
{
  "status": "success", 
  "message": "Operation completed successfully",
  "data": { /* response data */ }
}
```

**Error Response**
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Descriptive error message"
}
```
